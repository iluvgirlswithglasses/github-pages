# My Favorite Rock/Metal Albums

Rock/Metal stands unrivaled as the ultimate soundtrack for my hardcore ~4-hour programming sessions -- and you won't convince me otherwise. I mean, show me another genre that:

- Can kick your motivation into high gear like a shot of caffeine.
- Maintains a consistency that allows for compiling a playlist spanning thousands of hours, yet still delivers excellence from the first note to the very last.
- Is diverse enough to stay refreshing even with daily listening.
- Is crafted by individuals pursuing their own sounds, not clones.

No other genres check all these boxes. Each POP track is over in a blink; they stick to a repetitive rhythm for about 4 minutes, and then you're abruptly on a completely different musical journey, making a cohesive POP playlist an elusive dream. Classical music, well, lacks the caffeine kick and the necessary consistency (sorry so much classical fans). Lofi, on the other hand, drains all the adrenaline from my system. The only contenders that come close to Rock/Metal are EDM and its variants, but let's be honest, they just don't bring the same level of diversity.

With all that in mind, let's me introduce you to some of the finest albums in my collection. Be wary, there's gonna be a lot of Touhou.

## YaboiMatoi & RichaadEB

Meet these two maestros who serve as the perfect metal introductory for newcomers. Specializing in cover arrangements, particularly of Touhou tracks, their music boasts top-notch metal quality while preserving the pop-like melodies of the originals.

I recommend listening to these two guys for extremely long programming sessions, for that:

- Their arrangements highlight the inherently ear-catching melodies of the originals.
- You'll find cool guitar riffs and solos scattered throughout, making you feel like you can sprint forever.
- They rock hard enough to keep your concentration sharp without overwhelming you to exhaustion.
- Plus, they have some excellent vocal tracks -- check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Xz4NV0zsbY) one.

To get to know them, I wholeheartedly recommend their holy quadruple albums:

## Demetori

This is the band that introduced me to both Metal and Touhou; so without saying, this section features my most favorite metal band ever.

Despite the infamous longevity and vastness of the Touhou Project's fandom, Demetori's skill stands out like a thousand suns. Their artistry demonstrations are just unmatched:

- Firstly, their instrumental mastery, especially the tandem of the guitarist and the drummer. Pardon me for my blunt claim, but tbh: **DEMETORI HAS THE ULTIMATE FUSION OF GUITARS AND DRUMS**. Their guitar is **GODLY SOPHISTICATED**, so **FAST** yet so **PRECISE** and **EAR-CATCHING**; and they **LOVE** to show off **UNPARALLELED SOLOS** and **RIFFS**. All of this is backed up by the **MIRACULOUSLY COMMANDING** and **CAPTIVATING** drum notes.
- Secondly, their arrangement prowess. While prioritizing the essences of the original compositions, Demetori makes sure to leave their highly-distinguishable signature impression in every one of their tracks. Furthermore, I'm enamored by how Demetori seamlessly integrates multiple sub-genres like hard metal, progressive metal, thrash metal, and sometimes even folk into exceptional metal masterpieces.
- Finally, their quality consistency. If I were to compose a playlist of my favorite Demetori tracks, it would easily stretch over 4 hours.

I highly recommend these two playlists as an introduction to their music:

## Undead Corperation

Now, now, after two previous sections, you may feel that "Oh these are just boys showing off their guitar skills, things are still pretty tamed for me." Well, metal just isn't itself without losing some control, is it? In that case, let me introduce you to the untamed force that is Undead Corporation.

What defines Undead Corporation? Think potent guitar riffs, rapid-fire drum beats, and vocals that hit scream-core levels of intensity. These guys are the wildest rock band I've encountered in my five years of navigating the metal scene. While they also focus on Touhou re-arrangements like the previous bands, Undead Corporation takes a different approach -- they rip the melodies off and tune them into a chaotic symphony.

Yet, behind the chaos lies an ensemble of undeniably talented musicians. Crafting madness into something exciting and enjoyable is an exceptional talent in itself. I strongly suggest their tracks to accompany with you during tight and stressful deadline sprints.

By the way, did I tell you that these guys used car warning chime as an instrument in one of their pieces?

## Sally

After three complete sections exclusively about Touhou-focused bands, I introduce you to another Touhou circle: Sally.

Compared to the bands we've explored earlier, Sally is quite relaxed, steering away from the metal genre and positioning themselves as a rock band. Their music emits a laid-back vibe while still delivering catchy, emotionally-charged melodies. I've always had problems with songs that romanticize depression or emphasize emotional crises, thinking there's just no one who comprehends the subject matter and can accurately translate it into scores. Yet, Sally showed me how it sounds like.

A plus point is that, they have around a dozen of albums, each of them is around 30 minutes in duration, and their quality is consistent af. Here is my Sally Collection, plus a Butaotome album cuz their style is pretty similar:

This collection works well at keeping you concentrated, even when you're on low energy.
